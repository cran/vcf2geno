Some components have separate license and listed below:

1. zip
   We have used the following software and made minimal
   necessary changes: Zlib, Jean-loup Gailly <jloup@gzip.org> and
   Mark Adler <madler@alumni.caltech.edu> (License:
   http://zlib.net/zlib_license.html). We have changed its source
   code to not include stdio.h, and explicitly includes unistd.h
   heade file.

2. bzip2
   Julian Seward <jseward@bzip.org> (BSD
   license). We have renamed compress.c to bzCompress.c to avoid
   name collision with zlib.h, and its license files are renamed
   to bzip2.README and bzip2.LICENSE under src directory.

3. tabix
   Heng Li <lh3@live.co.uk> (MIT license). We removed standard IO related
   functions, e.g. printf, fprintf ; also changed its un-safe
   pointer arithmetics.

4. samtools/bcftools
   Heng Li <lh3@live.co.uk> (MIT license). We removed standard IO related
   functions, e.g. printf, fprintf ; also changed its un-safe
   pointer arithmetics.
